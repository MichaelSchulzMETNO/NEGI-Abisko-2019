*Climate science at high latitudes: eScience for linking Arctic measurements and modeling.*

The 3rd course “Climate science at high latitudes: eScience for linking Arctic measurements and modeling” will be held at Abisko Scientific Research Station from 15th until 24th of October 2019.

**Coordination**: Paul Zieger (SU), Michael Schulz (UiO/MetNo), and Katja Lauri (UHEL)

The registration has ended August 15th, 2019 (if you are still interested to join, please contact Paul to check for available places). Notification of acceptance will be given at the beginning of September. For more details please contact Paul Zieger.

## Course Content

The course in 2019 will introduce earth system analysis as well as data analysis with practical exercises. The course will make use of existing eSTICC related infrastructures, such as climate models (e.g., NorESM, EC-EARTH), model databases (e.g. AeroCom, CMIP5), model data evaluation portals (AeroCom, CMEMS), and atmospheric and oceanic databases (for example EBAS, ORA-IP). Practical work is initiated and accompanied to apply modern visualization, data analysis and statistical tools (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, AeroCom tools, ESMValTool, cis tool, barakuda tool). Subjects for practical work will be suggested depending on student’s background. Introductions will be given on the Arctic climate, the role of aerosols and clouds, observational techniques, climate forcing and climate model evaluation. The course involves a set of relevant lectures and tutorials, with the main emphasis placed on intensive group work and a final report that will be written during and after the course by each student. Before the course, the selected students will be asked to practice the tools to be used on the course by solving a pre-exercise. The course is primarily aimed at PhD students in atmospheric and biospheric sciences in Nordic universities (also advanced MSc students are welcome to apply). During the course the students can either use their own data or utilize provided model data together with long-term aerosol, air, ion, trace gas, meteorological data measured at field stations.
